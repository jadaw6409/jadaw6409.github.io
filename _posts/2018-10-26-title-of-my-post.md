With certainty the beginning week has been full of inadequate events in my opinion, on monday we learned the value and importance of quantative and categorial data. If you do not know what type of data that is I'll tell you, quantative is the arangment of numbers. But on the other hand categorial data is the organization of names for example, we use both types of data without noticing on the daily bases. The next class we used a packet that contained boolean expressions and word problems. With the expressions and word problems we had to first solve and see what we thought would be the right answer then use the computer to see if it was true or false. I later realized that the boolean expressions relate to the flags we created 2 weeks ago, I think they relate to one another because within the boolean expression it sometimes contained numbers. For example one expression was 4 + 2 + 6, it would return a sum. So like the flag it gets a number then applies it to the shape present. So challenges I had was getting the perfect fraction to center the flag when we did this activity.
