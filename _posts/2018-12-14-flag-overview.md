When creating a new project you may face some challenges and obstacles, but you can always over come that issue. This week when I was assembling my project that we all know as the Flag project Part #2, I had to code for a specific flag which was Tunisia. At first I had the hang of it because I created fractions to lable and place shapes at an exact position. I later came to realize with the help of my teacher that I needed to replace those numbers with definitions so that when I change or replace something it can remain in the same estate if that makes sense. So my teacher and I used the ratios that was given on the internet 0f the Tunisian ratio diagram. ```
