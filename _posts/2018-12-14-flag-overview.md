When creating a new project you may face some challenges and obstacles, but you can always over come that issue. This week when I was assembling my project that we all know as the Flag project Part #2, I had to code for a specific flag which was Tunisia. At first I had the hang of it because I created fractions to lable and place shapes at an exact position. I later came to realize with the help of my teacher that I needed to replace those numbers with definitions so that when I change or replace something it can remain in the same estate if that makes sense. So my teacher and I used the ratios that was given on the internet 0f the Tunisian ratio diagram. 
```size = 100
width = size * 3
height = size * 2
circle-diameter = height * 1/2
circle-radius = circle-diameter * 1/2
inner-diameter = height * 1/3
inner-radius = inner-diameter * 1/2
r= rectangle(width,height,"solid","red")
girl= circle(circle-radius,"solid","white")
bruh= place-image(r,height,inner-radius,girl)
spice= circle(75,"solid","red")
sass= circle(60,"solid","white")
kk= place-image(girl,400/2,240/2,r)
so= place-image(bruh,420/2,240/2,kk)
bash= place-image(so,460/2,240/2,sass)
wow= star(60,"solid","red")``` 
This code here helped create the proper measurements that I struggled creating when I first started the project. In addition with this code if I were to modify and enhance one piece it would be easier to make everything (the flag) remain proportion than making the flag a specific measure of number like I did in the beginning. And just to clarify I just randomly named these functions are definitions based on things I sometimes say, they have no coralation to actual names/or functions. However I still have a lot to pick up on a finish to make my Tunisian flag the offical final product. So lets hope the flag comes out great.
