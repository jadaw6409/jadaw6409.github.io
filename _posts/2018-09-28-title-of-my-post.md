This week in class we revisited the math concept of coordinates, the x and y values or known as axais'. On monday we played a video game called letsrun3. In that game we learned about what changes in the game, what were the challenges in the game, and what may be the targets in the game. So when we played the game we and realized that the coordinates of the player changes, and the image/background does as well. After learning that we had to apply the change in the coordinates to Priet and change a animation.
Some of the challenges I faced this week was getting the drone to drop the package in the right spot. In addition we had to move a ball to show the change in coordinates, so it can look like a step by step animation. Another challenged I faced was understanding the quardants, or how the player moves in each quardant. What I mean is that when the character moves around in a game the coordinates change, so when the animation processes that we had to estimate what point/coordinate we thought that was and I kind of struggled with that.
Lastly my feelings towards the overall class so far, I think that the class is good. But for others who aren't that well with code and used to this process it takes a lot of focus and thought in my opinion. In addition I think learning how things work then applying our learning has been really helpful then being blindsided. So hopefully things change for the better.
