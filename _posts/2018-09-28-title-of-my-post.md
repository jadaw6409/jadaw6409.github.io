This week in class we revisited the math concept of coordinates, the x and y values or known as axais'. On monday we played a video game called letsrun3. In that game we learned about what changes in the game, what were the challenges in the game, and what may be the target in the game. So when we played the game we realized that the coordinates of the player changes, and the image/background does as well.
