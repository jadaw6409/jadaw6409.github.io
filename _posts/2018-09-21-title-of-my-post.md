When hearing about this class for the first time I was skeptical, I say that because I was scared on how I was going to do in that class. So when hearing that we had to first create a blog for class I was excited. But after seeing how to create the code and layout for it I was upset on the process. However the ending result was worth the time to create and edit my own blog. But I recommend if you try this to take your time and read careful.
The biggest challenge for me in blog was to make everything work. What I mean by that is some pieces that you need to create would have errors and I would need to re-look or visit them to see the issue. However I also experienced trouble reading the directions carefully. Lastly having to wait to see the re-freshed result was a hassel but was worth it.
From this experience I learned a new way to created code for a personal online blog. In addition I am know able to share my learning with others who may want to do this on their own. But overall I've also realized that making a blog uses a lot of different pieces of html and code that I never thought would be used. So to summarize, I've learned the importance of patience with this project and what part html and css had in this website creation.
