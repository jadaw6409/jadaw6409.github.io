Week 10, So in class this week we came back to the Flag project and collage concepts. Like last time we make our selected flag but this time we chose our flag based on the level of diffuculty, the flag I chose was the flag of Tunisia. The Tunisian flag has a circle with a crescent and a star. So my job is to recreate the flag with the exact measurements and ratios. From this week I had diffuculty finding the ratios/measurements. When you get the exact measurements you have to create the "perfect" ratio so the rectangle for example can be centered. For the measurements I found out that the crescent and star are both 60 inches long and 9 inches wide. In addition to I had trouble with what to create on "pyreta' first, even though when yout first make something you lay down the foundation so what I settled on doing was making the rectangle/flag itself first. Now I have to creat the cricles and crescents then later on the star. Overall I don't think the flag project will be too diffucult.
