In class this week I felt overall lost on how things connected to each other. For example when we started making flags and learning about flags,css,markup lamguages and how they connected to computer science. So when we first started this weeks lesson I didn't really understand how everything related with one another. After learning about the first class it was hard to see the true relation to coding,but in the end I began to understood.This week we are learning about the importance and definition of each tag in coding. In each tag they have a different meaning and fraze what I mean by that is one tag may say <div> and another may say <ul>. Also we got to the learn about how to change our css and style of our blog, so to start the process of the css language we began to create flags to get the hang of shapes and different forms of css. Some of the struggles I began to realize I had was connecting and realating each topic to one another like I mentioned before, and how to operate/change the shapes on Pyret but I slowly understood. Overall this week was a cool experience of learning css, and the new markup language.
