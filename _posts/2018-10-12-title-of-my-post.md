On Tuesday class we went over the basic understanding on what shapes go into making our selected flag, what shapes make the flag and how are each shapes allined. Then we went on "pyret" and used the code that we are learning to apply it and create a flag. For example we know that the code or example circle(7,"solid","blue") creates a blue circle. So we began to take the knowledge of knowing how to create shapes. To complete this we did a strategy called "roles" with a driver and a navigator, with this strategy one person would type in the information and the other would take notes on what we did or need to do to complete the task. The next class day we took a look at eachothers reflections and gave constructive feedback. During the class this week I felt more involved/caught up with the class. Because what I can tell from last week, it wasn't the best learning experience for me. In addition I think that since we began to go over things as a group it has helped me understanding the main objective in the class. But my overall I didnt' really face any challenge this week. After that was done we were given time to organize and reflect on what happened in class this week to begin our weekly responses. That concludes the class and weekly reflection.
