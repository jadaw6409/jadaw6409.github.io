Welcome back to the blog ;) today it is week 9 this week, in the beginning of the week we went over the x and y values of a function called delivery which connected to the contract delivery state. In that contract delivery state it takes in 2 numbers and creates an x and y coordinate to return the package to the front of the house. After learning and reviewing the coordinates, we went into creating contracts that contained three different types of fields which were boolean, string, and number. Each field helped answer a specific series of questions that the contract and examples answered, so if I were to ask the computer birthday-cake.layers the result/response would be the amount of layers/the inputed answer like 10 for example. In addition we learned how to set up the templet and apply information in a data definition, this helped set up the example for the function Cake. With that knowledge we were able to conclude that data definitions are abstrations of tables they produce what is given in a table, general explanations of what's being applied. Towards the end of the week we as a class tried to construct a boolean example of a cake comparision. So in "Pyret" that would look like  ''' fun taller (cake1, cake2) '''
