What is a contract? Well let me tell you, a contract is a general statement on what a function/code may do. But on the other hand a definition tells you what the function specifically is going to do what is involved in the function and lastly what is going to be produce as a result. On Tuesday we learned how to make basic contracts a definitions for code. For example the function double takes in a number then produces a number twice the orginal amount  ```double(x): 2 * (x)```. That would be the function but the contract is double :: (x :: Number) -> Number.
