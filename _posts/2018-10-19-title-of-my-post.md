On Monday we took notes on how to overlap each shape to "connect the pieces of the puzzle". I chose the flag of Japan because I thought it would be a beginner flag that will be easy to understand to get me started with the coding process. In that class we also learned examples that we help with centering the shapes, the place-image program uses fractions and numbers that were used in the circle definition/function and divides it by 2 too center the shape. In addition when using the
