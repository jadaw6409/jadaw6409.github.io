Week 5 of Ap Computer Science, This week we created the final code and program of our flag. On the website Pyret we looked at a specific flag we wanted to replicate. On Monday we took notes on how to overlap each shape to "connect the pieces of the puzzle". I chose the flag of Japan because I thought it would be a beginner flag that will be easy to understand to get me started with the coding process. In that class we also learned examples that we help with centering the shapes, the place-image program uses fractions and numbers that were used in the circle definition/function and divides it by 2 too center the shape. In addition when using Pyret we had to make sure certain faises had quotations. Some of the challenges I had was getting the right position to center the circle in the flag of japan, and getting it to the right size so that it can be an exact copy of the Japan flag. Overall I hd fun with this but it was just time consuming to get it to the "perfect" flag.
